# Hello 👋

### My name is Clint Baker

- 🏔️ I live in Salt Lake City, UT
- 🧑‍💻 I'm a full stack Javascript developer
- 🏪 I have experience developing Shopify websites
- 🏌️‍♂️ I love to play golf

I'm a software developer with a proven ability to deliver robust, effective products in collaborative settings under strict and often tight time constraints. Developed many Shopify websites, apps, and microservices, to drive ecommerce operations and analysis for multiple entities, and ultimately facilitated the sale of $7M+ in digital revenue annually. Always seeking personal growth, I expanded my coding acumen through a 1,000+ hour coding Bootcamp focused on Javascript, where I was invited to return as a teaching assistant. I am now eager to tackle more complex challenges and continue to find ways to build Javascript solutions for real-world problems.

Reach out or give me a follow to stay up to date with my projects! Let's build something together!
